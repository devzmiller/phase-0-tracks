* Read through W3Schools jQuery tutorial, and use their "try it yourself" sections to test things. (Get overview and specific usages.)
* Find jQuery cheatsheet. (For future reference.)
* Skim jQuery docs (Read about intended uses and see if there's anything W3Schools didn't cover.)
* Try out some basic jQuery things 
* Find an example website that uses jQuery and look at their jQuery.
* Take a break to get up and move around after an hour.
