JQUERY LEARNING PLAN

* Read through W3Schools jQuery tutorial, and use their "try it yourself" sections to test things. (Get overview and specific usages.)
* Watch jQuery tutorial video.
* Find jQuery cheatsheet. (For future reference.)
* Skim jQuery docs (Read about intended uses and see if there's anything W3Schools didn't cover.)
* Try out some basic jQuery things 
* Find an example website that uses jQuery and look at their jQuery.
* Take a break to get up and move around after an hour.

W3Schools was the most useful, as reading kept me engaged and I could go at my own pace. But it was also really useful to watch tutorial videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMxGhHNOkCU) so I could see more variety of what you can do with jQuery. If I wanted to look further into jQuery, I would go through the rest of the W3Schools tutorial (I only did the basics) and watch more videos. I also found a couple of cheatsheets which may be useful for further reference.
