Release 4:

1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

HTML5 semantic tags are meant to divide up the page in a meaningful way. This makes it easier for people to read the HTML and see right away what each part of the page is for. It also makes it easier for people with disabilities; screen readers use semantic tags to know which parts of the page to read first/which to skip until needed. Semantic tags also help standardize HTML between different people/companies. The ones which seem most useful to me are the more specific ones, like nav, header, and footer. The others still leave some room for variations in usage, though I expect aside is very useful for screen readers as an aside could really interrupt the flow of a page if read in the wrong order.

2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser displays elements in the order they appear in the HTML document, regardless of the semantic meaning of the element. If you put the header last in the the document, it will appear last, even though it's the header.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned how to create a snippet. I might create more snippets in the future, especially if I'm making a website that has a lot of repeated similar sections.

4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The most confusing concept was the distinctions between some of the vaguer semantic elements, but I've mostly got it figured out after asking questions and looking at the flow chart.
